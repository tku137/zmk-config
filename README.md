## Licensing

This repository and any firmware binaries it produces are released under the **GNU GPL v3.0**.  
The combined work includes:

- **ZMK Firmware** (core framework), which is licensed under the **MIT License** (a GPL-compatible, permissive license).
- **flake-zmk-module** (Anywhy Flake shield definitions), which is licensed under the **GNU GPL v3.0**.

Because the flake-zmk-module is GPL-3.0, the final distributed firmware—containing both MIT-licensed and GPL-licensed components—must itself be licensed under **GPL v3.0**, with the full source code and GPL text made available.
